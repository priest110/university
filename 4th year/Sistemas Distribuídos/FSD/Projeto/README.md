# *Armazenamento de Pares Chave-Valor Distribu√≠do* (Distributed Key-Value Pair Storage)

The main objective of this work was to develop a distributed system for storing key-value pairs in memory, assuming an asynchronous system and taking advantage of logical clocks.

To learn more about this system, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
