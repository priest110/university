# *Servidor de Bases de Dados em Larga Escala* (Large Scale Database Server)

The main objective of this work was to implement a simple database system, using the client-server paradigm, in order to analyse the system behaviour, in particular to estimate its behaviour in a high performance and high demand system, calculating the installation and maintenance costs.

To learn more about this implementation, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
