# *Paralelização de um Ray Tracer Simples* (Parallelization of a Simple Ray Tracer)

The main objective of this work was to explore different performance optimisation techniques by exploiting parallelism in several aspects applied to a case study in Computer Graphics, a simple ray tracer.

To learn more about this implementation, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
