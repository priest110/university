# *Paralelização de um Algoritmo de Esqueletização de Imagens* (Parallelization of an Image Skeleton Algorithm)

The main purpose of this work was to develop a parallel implementation of an image skeletonisation algorithm, using PGM images.

To learn more about this implementation, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
