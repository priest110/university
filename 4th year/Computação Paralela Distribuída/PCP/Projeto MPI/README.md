# *Paralelização de um Algoritmo de Esqueletização de Imagens* (Parallelization of an Image Skeleton Algorithm)

The main purpose of this work was to develop a parallel implementation of an image skeletonisation algorithm, using PGM images. Unlike the first work of the course, where the interface used was OpenMP, in this second work the interface used was MPI.

To learn more about this implementation, I advise you to check the assignment [report](relatorio.pdf).
