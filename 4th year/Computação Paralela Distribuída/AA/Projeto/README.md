# *Matrix Multiplication*

The main purpose of this work was to study the performance of a simple matrix multiplication algorithm and its optimizations, implemented in C++ and C extensions, such as CUDA. We analyzed the various bottlenecks for the different optimizations to understand how they relate to the Roofline Model, in order to conclude the upper bound of the algorithmâ€™s performance.
