# *Solução Numérica para a Equação de Poisson* (Numerical solution to the Poisson Equation)

The main goal of this work was to implement a numerical solution to the Poisson Equation, using the Gauss Seidel and Successive Over-relaxation methods. Besides, we studied possible optimizations in parallel terms, using OpenMP.

To learn more about this solution, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
