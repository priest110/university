# *Algorithm otimization*

The main goal of this work was to implement and otimize two algorithms in order to obtain the best perfomance possible, using parallel techniques. Stencils and GeMM (General Matrix Multiply) were the two chosen.

To learn more about these algorithm optimisations, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
