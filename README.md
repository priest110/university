During my master's degree in Computer and Software Engineering I had the opportunity to evolve multiple skills, either through different fields of study, tools and 
technologies, or with different people and ways of working. In this repository, I summarize all the projects I developed and you can find out more about 
each one of them below.

**Note:** For each project, the syntax is as follows ":portugal: Subject [:uk: Subject]: Project(s)"

### 5th year

For the projects carried out in the 5th and final year I decided to dedicate different repositories, since they were made with other institutions besides the University of Minho. Below are the respective links to each work.

- [Projeto de Informática (PI)](https://github.com/priest110/Rosetta_Stone) [Informatics Project]: Rosetta Stone
- [Tese de Mestrado](https://github.com/priest110/master-thesis) [Master's Thesis]: Scientific Data Management
