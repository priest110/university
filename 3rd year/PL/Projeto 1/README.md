# *Projeto* (Project)

The aim of this project was to develop a better ability to write regular expressions to describe sentence patterns. In addition, it was important to develop regular language processors, which filter or transform texts based on the concept of Condition-Action production rules. Concretely, we developed a program that had the capacity to aceppt a project name and a template-multi-file description file and then created the initial files and folders of the project.

To know how to work with this program, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
