# *Programação Dinâmica Estocástica* (Dynamic Stochastic Programming)

For this project, the goal was to solve two Dynamic Stochastic Programming problems, one chosen by the teachers and the other by the working group research.

To find out how to solve both problems, I advise you to check the assignment [report](relatorio.pdf).
