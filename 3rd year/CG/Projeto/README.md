# *Sistema Solar* (Solar System)

The goal of this assignment was to develop a mini scene graph based 3D engine (specifically, the solar system) and provide usage
examples that show its potential. The assignment is split in four phases.

To learn more about this engine, I advise you to check the assignment report (*relatorio.pdf*).
