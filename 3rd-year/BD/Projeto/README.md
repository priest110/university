# *Sistemas de Gestão de Bases de Dados Relacionais e Não relacionais* (Relational and Non-Rational Database Management Systems)

This project aimed to analyse, plan, architect and implement a relational database mangement system, and it had the following theme: scheduling and conducting clinical tests of athletes from different sports and categories. In addition, it was necessary to implement the same system using a non-relational database.

To know how to work with these systems, I advise you to check the assignment [report](relatorio.pdf).
