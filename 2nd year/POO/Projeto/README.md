# *UMCarroJá!* (A car now!)

In this project a platform was developed to rent a car, like Uber or Bolt.

To run this application it is necessary to clone this project and:

```
cd UMCarroJá\!/
javac Aplicacao.java
```

To learn more about this service, I advise you to check the assignment [report](relatorio.pdf).
