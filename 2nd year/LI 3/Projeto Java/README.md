# *Sistema de Gest√£o de Vendas - SGV* (Sales Management System - SMS)

In this project, the objective was to develop a sales management system for a distributor with 3 branches. Unlike the first work of the course, where the language used was C, in this second work the language used was Java.

To know how to work with this system, I advise you to check the assignment [report](relatorio.pdf).
