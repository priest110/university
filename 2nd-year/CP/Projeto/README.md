# *Problemas* (Problems)

This project had two objectives:

- to solve several concrete problems with functional programming (with Haskell as the programming language);
- to learn to document programs, validate them and produce quality scientific-technical texts (with the help of lhs2tex).

To find out more about these problems and solutions, I advise you to check the assignment [report](cp1819t.pdf).
